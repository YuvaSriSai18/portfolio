          WebSockets vs. REST: Choosing the Right Protocol for Your Application
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="p">
          When building modern web applications, selecting the right
          communication protocol is crucial for performance, scalability, and
          user experience. Two popular protocols are WebSockets and REST.
          Understanding their differences, advantages, and appropriate use cases
          will help you choose the best option for your application.

          What is REST ?

        <Typography variant="p">
          <b style={{ fontWeight: 500 }}>
            REST (Representational State Transfer)
          </b>
          is an architectural style for building APIs, typically using HTTP
          requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
          RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a
          server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill
          the request. REST is widely used for its simplicity, scalability, and
          adherence to standard HTTP protocols.

          What is WebSocket ?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="p">
          <b style={{ fontWeight: 500 }}>Web Socket </b>is a protocol that
          provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP
          connection. Unlike REST, which is request-response based, WebSocket
          allows continuous two-way communication between the client and server.
          This makes it ideal for real-time applications where the server needs
          to push updates to the client without polling.

        <Typography variant="p">
          Choosing between WebSocket and REST depends on your application's
          requirements. Use REST for standard CRUD operations, where simplicity
          and scalability are key. Opt for WebSocket when real-time, low-latency
          communication is essential, such as in live chat, gaming, or
          collaborative tools. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of
          each protocol will ensure you select the best fit for your
          application's needs.
