        State Management in React: Using Context API vs Redux
      </Typography>
      <Typography mt={0.7}>
        State management is a crucial concept in React, especially as your
        application grows in complexity. Two popular tools for managing state in
        React are the <b>Context API</b> and <b>Redux</b>. Each has its
        strengths, and the choice between them depends on the needs of your
        application. Here’s a comparison of the two, along with their
        advantages, and tips on how to study them effectively.

            <b style={{ fontWeight: 600 }}>Scalability: </b> As applications
            grow, managing state becomes more complex. Proper state management
            ensures that your app remains maintainable and scalable.

            <b style={{ fontWeight: 600 }}>Component Communication: </b> State
            management allows for seamless communication between components,
            reducing the need for prop drilling (passing props down multiple
            levels).
